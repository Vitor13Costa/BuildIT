          <p class="biography">My name is Julian Montgomery, and I'm a Junior currently enrolled in AP Computer Science A. For this project, I helped build and integrate the backend service that processes uploaded 3D models, calculates mesh volumes using Trimesh, and estimates material costs based on user selections. I connected this backend to the frontend, handling multipart uploads, glb file parsing, and response formatting. My goal is to eventually work in the computer engineering field, with the ultimate goal of working hard so that other people's lives are easier.</p>

          <p class="biography">My name is Vitor Rangel da Costa, and I'm currently a junior studying AP Computer Science. I helped develop the backend for our group's cost-optimization platform. I focused mainly on database design and SQL development, building the full database and table structures to organize raw vendor data across materials such as metals, woods, plastics, and composites. I created optimized SQL queries that not only calculate the best cost per volume but also intelligently categorize items using string parsing techniques and efficient joins. Additionally, I worked to ensure the backend remained fast, scalable, and highly reliable, even as the amount of vendor and material information grew. Alongside my backend work, I also contributed to developing parts of the frontend, helping design and improve sections of the homepage for a more complete user experience. I also made sure the backend was easy to connect with the frontend, enabling a seamless experience for users to upload their CAD files and instantly receive the most cost-effective options available.</p>

          <p class="biography">Hi, I'm Swayn, and I am a sophomore studying computer science 1. In our website, I am the model designer for our team and in charge of creating all the models seen on the Explore tab, ranging from the exquisite items to everyday household items to the overly simple designs like the chest with a greek symbol on it. We wanted the user to explore all models in 3D and I used Tinkercad for this. Visualising each model as a concept and building them was a challenge, so was incorporating the 3D view for these on the webpage. I am so glad to be part of this team, where I learned a lot while having fun.</p>

          <p class="biography">My name is Addison Lee, and I'm currently a sophomore in AP Computer Science A. I worked on the front-end development of our website, focusing on both design and functionality. I rendered the crystal featured on the homepage using both Blender and Spline, with the goal of creating an immediately engaging and visually appealing experience. Additionally, I created a 3D viewer on the "Create" page using Three.js, enabling users to upload and label their models easily. I aspire to become a web developer known not only for creating beautiful, user-centered websites but also for continuously growing, both professionally and personally, each day.

          <p class="biography"> My name is Pavan Kumar Thottempudi, and I spent a significant amount of time learning HTML to support my group's frontend development, which is entirely HTML based. I helped design and build a webpage that allows users to download a CAD file template with the click of a button. This template can then be customized through various interactive parts of the website. I focused on making the feature user friendly and visually consistent with the rest of our site.</p>
